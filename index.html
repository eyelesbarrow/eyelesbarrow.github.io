  <h2>Review: A Mano Bianco 2015</h2>
  <p>Got this thing from Karstadt's sale bin for 8€. The wine is from Puglia, Italy. I haven't been there, but eventually, I will. The wine is quite fruity with peach and lemon peel flavors. On its own, it's good for sipping. Paired with slightly spicy food (I had this with chicken and rhubarb), the fruit flavors mellow. For 8€, it's pretty good. </p>

  <h2>Review: August Kesseler Riesling 2015</h2>
  <p> I bought this at Netto because my other wine shop was closed and I was desperate. Netto/Lidl/Aldi wines - they're a lottery. Sometimes, you get OK wines, sometimes it's crap. This August Kesseler bottle was on the higher end of the Netto offerings (7.99€!) The wine is on the too-sweet side of the spectrum, which on that regard, makes it a good wine for sipping on a sunny spring/ summer day, which is not happening any time soon in Berlin. </p>
